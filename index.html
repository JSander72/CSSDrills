      <h2>The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
      <p>Few genres have made as much use of the short story format as horror, and it’s difficult to say that any such
        writer stands above Poe. Known for penning many gothic masterpieces, The Tell-Tale Heart is Poe’s most renowned
        short story. Narrated by a murderer whose sanity gradually slips as he meditates on his crime and is haunted by
        the beating heart of his victim, this story helped to set the standard for early gothic romanticism.</p>

      <h2>The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka</h2>
      <p>Not only is The Metamorphosis one of the greatest short stories ever written, but it was an important
        forebearer of the Surrealist movement that would emerge shortly after its publication in 1915. The story of a
        salesman who wakes up one morning to find, much to his alarm, that he has turned into a beetle, there has been
        much debate over its meaning, but all agree that it is a masterful look at alienation in the modern age.</p>

      <h2>Hills Like White Elephants by Ernest Hemingway</h2>
      <p>Papa Hemingway wrote several short stories that could be ranked among the best of all time, but Hills Like
        White Elephants is perhaps his most brilliant effort thanks to how he talks directly about a subject without
        ever bringing it up at all. The story of a young couple waiting for a train as they discuss some never-clarified
        operation, it is nevertheless obvious that the man is attempting to pressure the woman into having an abortion.
        It is a masterpiece of subtlety and simplicity from a writer who is perhaps the greatest at packing an abundance
        of meaning into a minimal word count.</p>

      <h2>Cathedral by Raymond Carver.</h2>
      <p>By the late 1970s, short stories were waning in their public appeal. Then Raymond Carver rose to prominence and
        wrote some life back into the format with his unrivaled application of minimalism. The most renowned example of
        this was Cathedral, which is about a man’s jealousy toward his wife’s blind friend. By the time the two men bond
        over the image of a cathedral — which only one of them can actually see — the reader is left floored by the
        elegant simplicity of the story’s deceptively powerful ending.</p>
